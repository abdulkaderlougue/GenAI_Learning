Looking ahead, we’re excited to explore several promising directions that’ll further enhance our AI capabilities and drive innovation in knowledge management. Enabling AI agents to engage in multi-turn conversations will allow for more natural and intuitive interactions, mimicking human-like dialogue and improving the overall user experience. And developing self-reflective agents that can evaluate their own performance and adapt to new information will increase their autonomy and effectiveness, reducing the need for human intervention.

In addition, continuous fine-tuning of LLMs to align with specific business needs will enhance their relevance and accuracy, ensuring they meet the high standards of business environments. And lastly, expanding AI capabilities to support multiple languages will make our products more accessible and valuable to a global user base, fostering collaboration and productivity across diverse teams.
